## Code Snippets

Because there was a lot of code for this project, I will highlight three particular functions I'm proud of.
```javascript
const addEmp = () => {
    inquirer.prompt([
        {
            name: 'first_name',
            type: 'input',
            message: "What is your new employee's first name?"
        },
        {
            name: 'last_name',
            type: 'input',
            message: "What is your new employee's last name?"
        },
        {
            name: 'title',
            type: 'rawlist',
            message: "What is your new employee's title?",
            choices: roleArr
        },
        {
            name: 'manager_name',
            type: 'rawlist',
            message: "Who is your new employee's manager?",
            choices: empArr
        }
    ])
        .then((response) => {
            let manID;
            connection.query(`SELECT * FROM employees`, (err, employees) => {
                if (err) {
                    console.error(err);
                }
                for (i = 0; i < employees.length; i++) {
                    if (response.manager_name.includes(employees[i].last_name)) {
                        manID = employees[i].id;
                    }
                }

                let roleID;
                connection.query(`SELECT * FROM roles`, (err, roles) => {
                    if (err) {
                        console.error(err);
                    }
                    for (i = 0; i < roles.length; i++) {
                        if (response.title === roles[i].title) {
                            roleID = roles[i].id;
                        }
                    }
                    connection.query(`INSERT INTO employees SET ?`, { first_name: response.first_name, last_name: response.last_name, role_id: roleID, manager_id: manID }, (err, res) => {
                        if (err) {
                            console.error(err);
                        } else {
                            connection.query(`SELECT * from employees`, (err, res) => {
                                if (err) {
                                    console.error(err);
                                } else {
                                    console.table(res);
                                    console.log(`New employee added.`)
                                }
                            });
                        };
                        start();
                    });
                })
            })
        });

}
```

This is a look at the entire addEmp(). I will break it down below.

```javascript
    inquirer.prompt([
        {
            name: 'first_name',
            type: 'input',
            message: "What is your new employee's first name?"
        },
        {
            name: 'last_name',
            type: 'input',
            message: "What is your new employee's last name?"
        },
        {
            name: 'title',
            type: 'rawlist',
            message: "What is your new employee's title?",
            choices: roleArr
        },
        {
            name: 'manager_name',
            type: 'rawlist',
            message: "Who is your new employee's manager?",
            choices: empArr
        }
    ])
```

I wanted the user to be able to choose from the role titles instead of the role ids. I also wanted the user to be able to choose from employee full names instead of ids. The choices for each prompts are returned from the functions.

```javascript
const genRoleArr = (connection) => {
    let roleArr = [];
    connection.query(`SELECT * FROM roles`, (err, roles) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
        for (i = 0; i < roles.length; i++) {
            roleArr.push(roles[i].title);
        };
    });
    return roleArr;
};
```

This helper function collects all role objects, iterates through them, and pushes each role title to roleArr, which is returned.

```javascript
const genEmpArr = (connection) => {
    let empArr = [];
    connection.query(`SELECT * FROM employees`, (err, employees) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error(err);
        }
        for (i = 0; i < employees.length; i++) {
            empArr.push(employees[i].first_name + " " + employees[i].last_name);
        };
    });
    return empArr;
};

```

This helper function collects all employee objects, iterates through them, and pushes each role title to empArr, which is returned.

```javascript
        let manID;
            connection.query(`SELECT * FROM employees`, (err, employees) => {
                if (err) {
                    console.error(err);
                }
                for (i = 0; i < employees.length; i++) {
                    if (response.manager_name.includes(employees[i].last_name)) {
                        manID = employees[i].id;
                    }
                }
            });
```

This section of the addEmp function selects all employee objects, then uses the manager_name response to see if it includes any last name in an employee object. If it does, it sets manID to equal the id from that employee object. This conversion is required in order to successfully enter the new employee into the employees table.

```javascript
            let roleID;
                connection.query(`SELECT * FROM roles`, (err, roles) => {
                    if (err) {
                        console.error(err);
                    }
                    for (i = 0; i < roles.length; i++) {
                        if (response.title === roles[i].title) {
                            roleID = roles[i].id;
                        }
                    }
                });
```

This section of the addEmp function selects all role objects, then sets iterates through them. If the title response equals a title in a role object, roleID is set to equal that object's role_id. This conversion is required in order to successfully insert the new employee into the employees table.

```javascript
connection.query(`INSERT INTO employees SET ?`, { first_name: response.first_name, last_name: response.last_name, role_id: roleID, manager_id: manID }, (err, res) => {
                        if (err) {
                            console.error(err);
                        } else {
                            connection.query(`SELECT * from employees`, (err, res) => {
                                if (err) {
                                    console.error(err);
                                } else {
                                    console.table(res);
                                    console.log(`New employee added.`)
                                }
                            });
                        };
                        start();
                    });
```

This section of the addEmp function inserts the response data and the converted manager id and role id into the employees table. If there is no error, it then returns the employees table.

NOTE: the employees table return, and other tables returned after an add______(), were disabled in the submitted code because they were interfering with running through the app. There were issues with tables being cut off while displayed, and the user sometimes had to press an up or down arrow key in order to see the choices. This did not interfere with the overall functionality of the app. Everything works 100% as intended and designed if the tables are returned after an add______().
